# Contributing to smart-planner

We love your input! We want to make contributing as easy and transparent as possible.

## Development Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style

- We use Black for Python code formatting (line length: 100)
- We use flake8 for linting
- Type hints are required for all new code
- Docstrings required for all public functions/classes

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src tests/

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_specific.py
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if applicable
2. Update the CHANGELOG.md with your changes
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one maintainer
